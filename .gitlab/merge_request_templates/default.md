  build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
  ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
  docs: Documentation only changes
  perf: A code change that improves performance
  refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
  test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

Example scopes:
  core: for core changes
  api: for api changes
